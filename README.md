# superman_quiz_java
A simple quiz game using java, which I'd also like to give a go in C# in the next couple of weeks. This was designed to ease me back into the language, as we didn't use it for our capstone project, and also to prove to myself that I could keep my process thorough, test-driven and SOLID even for a mini project like this.

I realised very early on that I wasn't really making a Superman quiz, as much as a reusable template for a quiz game. Hopefully I find an excuse to use it to run quizzes for friends in the future. 

If you actually want to play the quiz, I recommend not peeking at the data in the runner file beforehand, as that will obviously spoil the answers for you. Just run the Runner.java file in your computer terminal and see how many you get right. Then use the template to write your own quiz, of course.
